# Explosion Sudoku
It's like regular sudoku but with a twist. You place numbers 1-9 on the board, and they can't repeat within that box, row, or column. The twist is when a number is incorrectly placed, it explodes, erasing all numbers in the box. This forces the player (just 1) to replace the numbers. Additionally, if all the numbers are gone, then the player loses.
